# Svench

In the future, we would like to use https://github.com/rixo/svench for a Storybook like (but much lighter and faster) prototyping and documentation tool. Currently it has an issue and the author is waiting until SvelteKit reaches 1.0 before getting it production ready. Vitebook is making a lot of progress and Storybook has also made progress in making things work faster w/ Vite so those could also be looked at.
